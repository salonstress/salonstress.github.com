<h2> Week 1	</h2>

<ul>
	<li> <h3>Three Proposed Web Sites <a href="index.html"></a></h3></li> 
		<li>Small Business</li>
		STATION 8 SALON - Jamaica Plain based hair salon.  I chose this business because it is located one block form my home and because one of the owners is a friend. I have done photo shoots of hair models for them in the past, so I have plenty of image-based content already.
