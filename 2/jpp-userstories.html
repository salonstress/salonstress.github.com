	<h1>Jamaica Pond Park Site User Stories </h1>
	
<ul>

	
	<li><h2>Research Paper Robert, 13</h2><br/>
	
	He's in the seventh grade at Boston Latin school, born and raised in Boston and lives in Jamaica Plain with his family.  He's writing a research paper on his neighborhood for school.  He's visiting the site in an effort to find historical information about the park (and possibly some photos to grab from the web and include in his project).   He will likely end up on this site through a basic google search, and would benefit from external links that provide further information about the neighborhood or the history of the park.
	</li>

<li><h2>Paula The Planner, 40</h2><br/>
	She lives on the Jamaicaway with her two children, a daughter aged 10 and a son aged13.  She's looking to find out about events that might be happening in the park during the coming weeks so that she can make plans for the weekend with her kids.  She's also interested in checking out the site's photo gallery because she attended an event at the park recently, the annual Lantern Parade, and would like to see some photos from that day, possibly featuring her kids or other people she knows.</li>
	
	<li><h2>JP Newcomer Norah, 25</h2><br/>
		She recently finished graduate school in Boston, and just moved to Jamaica Plain.  She's originally from the midwest, but fell in love with the city while in school.  She lives in an apartment near the park with her two dogs, enjoys the outdoors, and is community-minded.  She was struck by the beauty of the pond upon moving to the neighborhood, and is visiting the site to look into upcoming events in an effort to become a more active member of the JP community. </li>
		
		<li><h2>Sailor Sam, 50</h2><br/>
			He's 50 years old, lives in nearby Dorchester, and has been sailing on the Charles most of his life.  He's visiting the site specifically to find out about sailing lessons and the sailing situation overall offered at the pond during the summer, as he'd like to sail with his nephew on a smaller body of water soon.</li>
